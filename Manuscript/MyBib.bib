  abstract  = "Climate change will increase the frequency, intensity and
               duration of weather extremes including heat-waves, which could
               have important consequences for biodiversity. This thesis
               examines the direct influences of thermal stress associated with
               heat-wave conditions on reproduction in a model insect in order
               to understand how animal populations might be affected by
               climate change. Fertility reductions in homeotherms due to
               thermal stress are well documented, but effects on ectotherms
               have received little attention. In the first half of this
               thesis, the flour beetle model Tribolium castaneum is used to
               measure the impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproductive
               fitness in males and females, and the proximate mechanisms
               behind any impacts. I find that the reproductive fitness of
               males, but not females, is impacted by heat-wave conditions.
               Female fecundity is not affected when mating with heat stressed
               males, but egg hatch and pupal eclosion rates are reduced.
               Transgenerational effects were not found beyond the pupal stage.
               In experimental examinations of mating behaviour, males exposed
               to heat-wave conditions were slower to initiate mating and mated
               less frequently, but still achieving sufficient matings that
               would normally allow full female fertility. However, ejaculate
               sperm numbers were reduced more than five-fold following a
               simulated heat-wave, partly explaining how male reproductive
               fitness is halved following exposure to a heat-wave. In addition
               to an impact on male fertility and sperm production, I also
               found clear evidence that sperm in female storage were also
               sensitive to heat-wave conditions, with significant declines in
               female reproductive fitness if they had already mated and
               contained sperm, but no effects if the heat-wave was experienced
               before mating and sperm storage. This sensitivity of male
               fertility to heat-wave conditions could generate selection on
               both males and females to respond. In the second half of the
               project, the male and female responses to thermal stress and
               their impacts across generations were investigated. Females were
               found to be able to rescue their fertility when facing matings
               with heat stressed males by mating polyandrously, restoring
               their reproductive output to normal levels. However, I found no
               evidence that females strategically or facultatively adjusted
               their remating behaviour to compensate for reductions in
               fertility condition after thermal stress, and multi-generational
               male responses to elevated ambient temperature regimes showed no
               evidence for an ability to acclimate or adapt to heat-wave
               conditions. This thesis advances our knowledge of how one
               important trait for population viability and biodiversity can be
               impacted by climate change and increases in extreme weather
               conditions. It offers directions for future research to
               investigate the drivers of temperature-induced male fertility
               loss, and suggestions for how management efforts might be
               focused to mitigate the impacts of heat-wave conditions on
               reproduction in ectotherms",

  abstract = "We propose a novel theory for the evolution of polyandry driven
              by genetic benefits to females whose offspring interbreed. In
              species with an ecology characterized by frequent colonization of
              new habitat patches, consanguineous matings may be common during
              the early stages of colonization, but genetic diversity may grow
              as new colonizers arrive. We show that with levels of inbreeding
              depression similar to those found in predominantly inbreeding
              populations, a polyandrous female can benefit her descendants
              since matings among her brood are mainly between half siblings
              rather than full siblings. We examine the invasion by a
              polyandrous phenotype using explicit genetic models in which
              costs of inbreeding are themselves subject to selection. In
              common with other models of inbreeding, we find that underlying
              high levels of inbreeding tend to purge deleterious recessive
              alleles, and hence these are unlikely to maintain sufficient
              inbreeding depression to favour polyandry. However, if costs of
              inbreeding are due to overdominance, biologically realistic
              levels of inbreeding depression result in genetic benefits large
              enough to favour polyandry provided it is not too costly. The
              potential significance of polyandry as a mechanism to reduce
              inbreeding in grandchildren will depend upon the genetic basis of
              inbreeding depression in natural, inbreeding populations.",

  abstract = "Strong sexual selection has been reported to both enhance and
              hinder the adaptive capacity and persistence of populations when
              exposed to novel environments. Consequently, how sexual selection
              influences population adaption and persistence under stress
              remains widely debated. Here, we present two empirical
              investigations of the fitness consequences of sexual selection on
              populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella,
              exposed to stable or gradually increasing temperatures. When
              faced with increasing temperatures, strong sexual selection was
              associated with both increased fecundity and offspring survival
              compared with populations experiencing weak sexual selection,
              suggesting sexual selection acts to drive adaptive evolution by
              favouring beneficial alleles. Strong sexual selection did not,
              however, delay extinction when the temperature became excessively
              high. By manipulating individuals' mating opportunities during
              fitness assays, we were able to assess the effect of multiple
              mating independently from the effect of population-level sexual
              selection, and found that polyandry has a positive effect on both
              fecundity and offspring survival under increasing temperatures in
              those populations evolving with weak sexual selection. Within
              stable temperatures, there were some benefits from strong sexual
              selection but these were not consistent across the entire
              experiment, possibly reflecting changing costs and benefits of
              sexual selection under stabilizing and directional selection.
              These results indicate that sexual selection can provide a buffer
              against climate change and increase adaptation rates within a
              continuously changing environment. These positive effects of
              sexual selection may, however, be too small to protect
              populations and delay extinction when environmental changes are
              relatively rapid.",

              explanation, because it carries fitness costs in many species.
              When mated females disperse alone to a new habitat, their
              offspring may have no option but to mate with their siblings and
              incur inbreeding depression. However, some of the offspring of
              polyandrous females may only be half siblings, reducing
              inbreeding depression when isolated groups of siblings only have
              each other as mates. We investigated this putative benefit of
              polyandry over monandry by initiating multiple genetically
              isolated populations of Callosobruchus maculatus beetles, each
              founded by a single female, who received a complete ejaculate
              from either one or two males. The early generations had

              egg-to-adult survival than the descendants of singly inseminated
              females. This fitness benefit was of similar magnitude whether
              beetles were reared on their standard food plant, or on a less
              favourable food source. Our results suggest that polyandrous
              females produce fitter descendants in inbred founder populations

              polyandrous female sierra dome spiders combined with
              electrophoretic paternity studies were used to evaluate three
              hypotheses about genetic benefits of polyandry: (1) best male,
              (2) genetic diversity, and (3) genetic bet-hedging. Females
              nearing maturation rely upon intrasexual fighting to determine
              their first mate (Watson: Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 1990, 26,
              77--90). Phenotypic attributes of first mates did not predict
              their fertilization success. In contrast, copulatory vigour and
              weight (uncorrelated traits) were among nine factors (out of 23
              tested) that predicted the fertilization success of later,
              secondary mates. Secondary mates were seldom required to fight
              other males; variation in their reproductive success was
              apparently due to female choice. The value of copulatory vigour
              and weight in predicting the outcome of fights between males
              suggested that intrasexual and intersexual selection are in
              accord. First mate sperm precedence may have evolved because
              intersexual selection of secondary mates is a weaker test of male
              quality than the purely combative process that determines first
              mates. However, when by chance only inferior males discover a
              virgin female, her first mate will merely be the best of a bad
              lot. Such `errors' in the selection of primary sires may underlie
              the adoption of a bet-hedging strategy, whereby genetically based
              correlations in viability among offspring are reduced, especially
              when selection fails to prevent fertilizations by a low quality
              male. Further, examination of linyphiid genitalia suggested a
              female mechanism to sequester male ejaculates, allowing control

  abstract = "Why are females so choosy when it comes to mating? This question
              has puzzled and marveled evolutionary and behavioral ecologists
              for decades. In mating systems in which males provide direct
              benefits to the female or her offspring, such as food or shelter,
              the answer seems straightforward--females should prefer to mate
              with males that are able to provide more resources. The answer is
              less clear in other mating systems in which males provide no
              resources (other than sperm) to females. Theoretical models that
              account for the evolution of mate choice in such
              nonresource-based mating systems require that females obtain a
              genetic benefit through increased offspring fitness from their
              choice. Empirical studies of nonresource-based mating systems
              that are characterized by strong female choice for males with
              elaborate sexual traits (like the large tail of peacocks) suggest
              that additive genetic benefits can explain only a small
              percentage of the variation in fitness. Other research on genetic
              benefits has examined nonadditive effects as another source of
              genetic variation in fitness and a potential benefit to female
              mate choice. In this paper, we review the sexual selection
              literature on genetic quality to address five objectives. First,
              we attempt to provide an integrated framework for discussing
              genetic quality. We propose that the term 'good gene' be used
              exclusively to refer to additive genetic variation in fitness,
              'compatible gene' be used to refer to nonadditive genetic
              variation in fitness, and 'genetic quality' be defined as the sum
              of the two effects. Second, we review empirical approaches used
              to calculate the effect size of genetic quality and discuss these
              approaches in the context of measuring benefits from good genes,
              compatible genes and both types of genes. Third, we discuss
              biological mechanisms for acquiring and promoting offspring
              genetic quality and categorize these into three stages during
              breeding: (i) precopulatory (mate choice); (ii) postcopulatory,
              prefertilization (sperm utilization); and (iii) postcopulatory,
              postfertilization (differential investment). Fourth, we present a
              verbal model of the effect of good genes sexual selection and
              compatible genes sexual selection on population genetic variation
              in fitness, and discuss the potential trade-offs that might exist
              between mate choice for good genes and mate choice for compatible
              genes. Fifth, we discuss some future directions for research on

              trivial, and the empirical comparison of the across-generations
              fitness payoffs of a polyandrous (bet hedger) versus a monandrous
              (non-bet hedger) strategy has never been accomplished because of

              About 25 years ago it was hypothesized that bet-hedging could
              function as a mechanism favoring the evolution of polyandry, but
              this idea is controversial because theory indicates that
              bet-hedging via polyandry can compensate the costs of mating only
              in small populations. Nevertheless, populations are often
              spatially structured, and even in the absence of spatial
              structure, mate-choice opportunity can be limited to a few
              potential partners. We examined the effectiveness of bet-hedging
              in such situations with simulations carried out under two
              scenarios: (1) intrinsic male quality, with offspring survival
              determined by male phenotype (male's ability to generate viable
              offspring), and (2) genetic incompatibility (offspring fitness
              determined nonadditively by parental genotypes). We find higher
              fixation probabilities for a polyandrous strategy compared to a
              monandrous strategy if complete reproductive failure due to male
              effects or parental incompatibility is pervasive in the
              population. Our results also indicate that bet-hedging polyandry
              can delay the extinction of small demes. Our results underscore

              sexual selection to clear the universal fitness constraint of
              mutation load. Under sexual selection, competition between
              (usually) males and mate choice by (usually) females create
              important intraspecific filters for reproductive success, so that
              only a subset of males gains paternity. If reproductive success
              under sexual selection is dependent on individual condition,
              which is contingent to mutation load, then sexually selected
              filtering through 'genic capture' could offset the costs of sex
              because it provides genetic benefits to populations. Here we test
              this theory experimentally by comparing whether populations with
              histories of strong versus weak sexual selection purge mutation
              load and resist extinction differently. After evolving replicate

              Lineages from populations that had previously experienced strong

              fitness under inbreeding, with some families continuing to
              survive after 20 generations of sib $\times$ sib mating. By
              contrast, lineages derived from populations that experienced weak
              or non-existent sexual selection showed rapid fitness declines
              under inbreeding, and all were extinct after generation 10.
              Multiple mutations across the genome with individually small

              unclear whether sexual selection is beneficial for total lineage
              fitness, or if it acts as a constraint. Sexual selection could be
              a positive force because of selection on improved individual
              condition and purging of mutation load, summing into lineages
              with superior fitness. On the other hand, sexual selection could
              negate potential net fitness through the actions of sexual
              conflict, or because of tensions between investment in sexually
              selected and naturally selected traits. Here, we explore these
              ideas using a multigenerational invasion challenge to measure
              consequences of sexual selection for the overall net fitness of a
              lineage. After applying experimental evolution under strong
              versus weak regimes of sexual selection for 77 generations with
              the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, we measured the overall
              ability of introductions from either regime to invade into
              conspecific competitor populations across eight generations.
              Results showed that populations from stronger sexual selection
              backgrounds had superior net fitness, invading more rapidly and
              completely than counterparts from weak sexual selection
              backgrounds. Despite comprising only 10\% of each population at
              the start of the invasion experiment, colonizations from strong
              sexual selection histories eventually achieved near-total
              introgression, almost completely eliminating the original
              competitor genotype. Population genetic simulations using the
              design and parameters of our experiment indicate that this
              invasion superiority could be explained if strong sexual
              selection had improved both juvenile and adult fitness, in both

  abstract  = "Abstract: In theoretical and experimental approaches to the
               study of sperm competition, it is often assumed that ejaculates
               always contain enough sperm of good quality and that they are
               successfully transferred and used for fertilization. However,
               this view neglects the potential effects of infertility and
               sperm limitation. Permanent or temporal male infertility due to
               male sterility, insemination failures, or failures to fertilize
               the ova implies that some males do not achieve sperm
               representation in the female reproductive tract after mating. A
               review of the literature suggests that rates of nonsperm
               representation may be high; values for the proportion of
               infertile matings across 30 insect species vary between 0\% and
               63\%, with the median being 22\%. I simulated P2 (the proportion
               of offspring fathered by the second male to copulate with a
               female in a double?mating trial) distributions under a mechanism
               of random sperm mixing when sample sizes and rates of male
               infertility varied. The results show that nonsperm
               representation can be responsible for high intraspecific
               variance in sperm precedence patterns and that it can generate
               misleading interpretations about the mechanism of sperm
               competition. Nonsperm representation might be a common obstacle

              with the traditional concepts of the choosy, monogamous female
              and the coadapted gene complex increasingly giving way to the
              realization that sexual reproduction engenders conflicts,
              promotes polyandry, and thereby provides females with a cryptic
              arsenal of postcopulatory processes with which to safeguard their
              investment in large, costly eggs. As research focuses on
              reproduction from the female perspective, evidence is emerging
              that polyandry can provide genetic benefits that enhance female
              reproductive success. In this review, we propose that
              reproductive mode is a critically important factor influencing
              the type of genetic benefits that females gain by mating with
              more than one male. Among the hypotheses that propose genetic
              benefits to polyandry, there is a distinction between those that
              posit benefits from intrinsic (additive) effects of paternal
              genes in offspring, and those that propose a benefit resulting
              from defence against incompatibility. Polyandry to acquire
              superior paternal genes and polyandry as a defence against
              incompatibility are not mutually exclusive hypotheses. However,
              evidence from reproductive physiology, immunology and
              evolutionary conflict theory suggest that development of the
              embryo within the female makes polyandry for incompatibility

              attributed to the material (direct) benefits derived from male
              mating resources (e.g. nuptial gifts) accrued by multiple mating.
              However, genetic (indirect) benefits offer a more robust
              explanation since only polyandrous, not monandrous, females may
              gain both material benefits from multiple mating and genetic
              benefits from multiple sires. Discriminating between material and
              genetic benefits is essential when addressing the mechanism by
              which polyandry is adaptively maintained, but are difficult to
              disentangle because they affect fitness in similar ways. To test
              the hypothesis that genetic benefits maintain polyandry, we
              compared four components of fitness (longevity, fecundity,
              hatching success and survivorship) between monandrous and
              polyandrous females in the ground cricket, Allonemobius socius.
              We discovered that females derived nongenetic benefits from
              mating multiply, in that the magnitude of the nuptial gift was
              positively associated with the number of eggs produced. However,
              polyandrous females had over a two-fold greater hatching success
              and a 43\% greater offspring survivorship, leading to a
              significantly higher relative fitness than the monandrous
              strategy. These results were independent of the confounding
              effects of material benefits, implying that genetic contributions

              Although it is often stated in the literature that the
              deleterious effects of inbreeding (inbreeding depression) are
              expected to be more pronounced under stressful than benign
              conditions, this issue remains unresolved and controversial. We
              review the current literature on the relationship between the
              magnitude of inbreeding depression and environmental stress and
              calculate haploid lethal equivalents expressed under relatively
              benign and stressful conditions based on data from 34 studies.
              Inbreeding depression increases under stress in 76\% of cases,
              although this increase is only significant in 48\% of the studies
              considered. Estimates of lethal equivalents are significantly
              greater under stressful (mean = 1.45, median = 1.02) than
              relatively benign (mean = 0.85, median = 0.61) conditions. This
              amounts to an approximately 69\% increase in inbreeding
              depression in a stressful vs a benign environment. However, we

               increasing evidence that female fitness can depend on the number
               of mates obtained. A number of genetic benefits have been
               proposed for the evolution of polyandry. A meta-analysis of
               available data suggests that polyandry, rather than multiple
               mating, can have a weak but significant general effect on embryo
               viability, as indicated by egg hatching success. Although this
               effect is generally regarded as evidence in favor of the genetic
               incompatibility hypothesis, appropriate data that test for
               intrinsic sire effects on embryo viability are generally
               unavailable. Moreover, maternal effects that could generate the
               result have not been adequately controlled, and there is little
               unequivocal evidence to suggest that fertilization is biased
               toward sperm bearing genotypes that would enhance offspring
               viability. Greater effort is required in these areas to
