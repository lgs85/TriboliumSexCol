  abstract  = "Climate change will increase the frequency, intensity and
               duration of weather extremes including heat-waves, which could
               have important consequences for biodiversity. This thesis
               examines the direct influences of thermal stress associated with
               heat-wave conditions on reproduction in a model insect in order
               to understand how animal populations might be affected by
               climate change. Fertility reductions in homeotherms due to
               thermal stress are well documented, but effects on ectotherms
               have received little attention. In the first half of this
               thesis, the flour beetle model Tribolium castaneum is used to
               measure the impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproductive
               fitness in males and females, and the proximate mechanisms
               behind any impacts. I find that the reproductive fitness of
               males, but not females, is impacted by heat-wave conditions.
               Female fecundity is not affected when mating with heat stressed
               males, but egg hatch and pupal eclosion rates are reduced.
               Transgenerational effects were not found beyond the pupal stage.
               In experimental examinations of mating behaviour, males exposed
               to heat-wave conditions were slower to initiate mating and mated
               less frequently, but still achieving sufficient matings that
               would normally allow full female fertility. However, ejaculate
               sperm numbers were reduced more than five-fold following a
               simulated heat-wave, partly explaining how male reproductive
               fitness is halved following exposure to a heat-wave. In addition
               to an impact on male fertility and sperm production, I also
               found clear evidence that sperm in female storage were also
               sensitive to heat-wave conditions, with significant declines in
               female reproductive fitness if they had already mated and
               contained sperm, but no effects if the heat-wave was experienced
               before mating and sperm storage. This sensitivity of male
               fertility to heat-wave conditions could generate selection on
               both males and females to respond. In the second half of the
               project, the male and female responses to thermal stress and
               their impacts across generations were investigated. Females were
               found to be able to rescue their fertility when facing matings
               with heat stressed males by mating polyandrously, restoring
               their reproductive output to normal levels. However, I found no
               evidence that females strategically or facultatively adjusted
               their remating behaviour to compensate for reductions in
               fertility condition after thermal stress, and multi-generational
               male responses to elevated ambient temperature regimes showed no
               evidence for an ability to acclimate or adapt to heat-wave
               conditions. This thesis advances our knowledge of how one
               important trait for population viability and biodiversity can be
               impacted by climate change and increases in extreme weather
               conditions. It offers directions for future research to
               investigate the drivers of temperature-induced male fertility
               loss, and suggestions for how management efforts might be
               focused to mitigate the impacts of heat-wave conditions on
               reproduction in ectotherms",
